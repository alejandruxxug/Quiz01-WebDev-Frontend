# Readme WebQuiz 1.0

Okay so this is the app, made by Alejandro Urrego Giraldo

## Disclaimer
One thing I just couldnt do is just bypass native validation and have the red error message on the result output

I could just not have the minlenght on the html 
either way, the logic is coded so whether I remove it or not it would still work and show the output

## Features/Additions

Added a navbar and a footer section with their css counterparts (Basic though)

Used the .classlist().add/remove() to add the css class and style to the result (this, I looked up on google on how to do it).

The app basically tells you messages for different moods that you have, also validates that you input it a somewhat real name.

The submission is handled by JS so the page doesnt reload .

Idk what else to put this is me and i like to make my assignments in english hehe sorry if it's a burden to understand TwT. Also sorry fot he late commits i totally forgot about the Readme.md sorry
